## ComHomeServer: Project to improve the official website of the Department of Computer Science
### ðŸ¥ˆ Won Silver prize at 2022 SUNGSHIN SOFTWARE CONTEST.

The existing site of the Department of Computer Science at Sungshin Women's University did not have a notification function, so students could not check the announcement immediately. Also, the layout and content did not respond well to the resolution of the webpage, so students could not check the content properly. 
ComHome solved these inconveniences of the existing website, and also improved the website and added new features such as implementing a chat function for active exchange between alumni and current students, KakaoTalk sharing, clipping, project exhibition board, and student council announcement calendar.

**I implemented the function for**

- Login to only Sungshin Gmail account (used Oauth2 Library)
- Chat with alumni such as Bubble Service (used socket.io)
- Project exhibition & Notice board CRUD and wrote API statement
